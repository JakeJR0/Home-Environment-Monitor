# Sensors

## Creating your own Sensor Instance

### Required Items
- 1 - 4: [ESP-8266](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08NJGVZVR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
- 1 [Smart Plug](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Z942YWS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- 1: [DHT22 Sensor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0824TDQSR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Optional [Magnetic Sensor](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B085XQLQ3N/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

### Sensor Setup
Since the project needs [Micro-Python](https://micropython.org/) to run the code, you will need to grab a version to flash the [ESP-8266]() for this project I used the 
`esp8266-20220618-v1.19.1` for the project. Additionally you will need an IDLE to flash the [ESP-8266](), I would recommend [Thorny IDLE](https://thonny.org/) for this
task as it is quite lightweight and seems to work well with [Micro-Python](https://micropython.org/).

To get the required code for the sensor, you can clone this repository and grab the required files from the directory that is relevent.

```
  git clone https://github.com/JakeJR0/Home-Control.git
```

##### Notice
Due to time constraints I have not tested that the magnetic sensor code works completely at this moment in time, though I will be ensuring that the code works at a later time.
